# SurrealAI
Game-playing AI using surreal numbers 

This project was inspired by the first volume [Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays](https://www.amazon.com/Winning-Ways-Your-Mathematical-Plays/dp/1568811306). It uses surreal numbers to create an AI capable of playing a specific class of games. This is a proof of concept project, and will run slowly on large instances of games.

## Details
The repo provides an abstract Game class, and lists the requirements for the games this project was made for. Currently, the only game implmented is [Nim](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nim)
